Assignment 1 README
Overview
This repository contains materials for Assignment 1, focusing on AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) parameters in high-speed networking. The assignment involves numerical experiments, a report, and code submission.

Submission Requirements
1. Report
Prepare a report (5 pages max) in Word or Latex with the following sections:

Explore AIMD Parameters:

Overview of AIMD parameters.
Reference to demonstrations, e.g., logarithmic function of window size.
Consideration of different functions for alpha and beta parameters.
Reference: https://www.evl.uic.edu/eric/atp/HighSpeedTCP.pdf.
Numerical Examples and Experiments:

Experiments with TCP users/flows sharing a bottleneck.
Demonstrate convergence of TCP dynamics, e.g., using matrix A right eigenvector.
Discussion:

Analysis and discussion based on numerical experiments.
Conclusion:

Summary of key insights and conclusions.
Appendix:

Attach code, preferably as a Jupyter Notebook PDF.
2. Code
Attach the experimentation code to the repository.

Code Language
Use any programming language for implementation.
